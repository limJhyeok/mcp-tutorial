DEPRECATED: Use read_text_file instead.\nArguments:\n- path: No description (required)\n- tail: If provided, returns only the last N lines of the file\n- head: If provided, returns only the first N lines of the file\n\nTool: read_text_file\nDescription: Read the complete contents of a file from the file system as text. Handles various text encodings and provides detailed error messages if the file cannot be read. Use this tool when you need to examine the contents of a single file. Use the 'head' parameter to read only the first N lines of a file, or the 'tail' parameter to read only the last N lines of a file. Operates on the file as text regardless of extension. Only works within allowed directories.\nArguments:\n- path: No description (required)\n- tail: If provided, returns only the last N lines of the file\n- head: If provided, returns only the first N lines of the file\n\nTool: read_media_file\nDescription: Read an image or audio file.

Each entry includes 'name', 'type' (file/directory), and 'children' for directories. Files have no children array, while directories always have a children array (which may be empty). The output is formatted with 2-space indentation for readability. Only works within allowed directories.\nArguments:\n- path: No description (required)\n\nTool: move_file\nDescription: Move or rename files and directories.
